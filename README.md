# CulturePass

CulturePass is a cross-platform Expo + React Native app for cultural discovery in Australia. The engineering baseline for this repository is a white-first marketplace UX, stable canonical routing across native and web, and strict design-system enforcement.

## Platform Coverage

| Platform | Technology | Distribution |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| iOS | React Native (Expo) | App Store via EAS Build |
| Android | React Native (Expo) | Google Play via EAS Build |
| Web | Expo Web (same Expo app codebase) | Firebase Hosting |

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Expo + React Native)
├── app/              # File-based routing (Expo Router)
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── constants/        # Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, animations)
├── contexts/         # Client state (auth, onboarding, saved, contacts)
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── lib/              # Auth, API client, feature flags, utilities
└── shared/           # Shared TypeScript types (Drizzle schema)

Backend (Firebase Functions + Express)
├── functions/src/            # Express API + middleware + services
├── functions/src/services/   # Firestore, search, cache, rollout
└── functions/src/middleware/ # Auth + moderation

Cloud (Firebase)
├── functions/        # Cloud Functions (events, payments, tickets, webhooks)
└── firebase.json     # Hosting + security headers
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Quality checks
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript
npm run qa:all        # Unit + integration + E2E smoke tests

# 3. Start development
npm run start         # Expo dev server (iOS / Android / Web)
firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,auth,storage
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Point frontend at your API (recommended)
export EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001/<project>/us-central1/api/

# Control feature rollout phase
export ROLLOUT_PHASE=internal   # internal | pilot | half | full

# Optional emulator wiring in Expo dev mode
export EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=true
export EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

## Build and deploy

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full deployment instructions.

Publishing readiness checklist: [`docs/PUBLISHING_READINESS.md`](docs/PUBLISHING_READINESS.md).

### iOS App Store
```bash
npm run build:ios:production
npm run submit:ios:production
```

### Google Play Store
```bash
npm run build:android:production
npm run submit:android:production
```

### Remote tester distribution
```bash
# Internal preview builds (share install links from Expo dashboard)
npm run build:ios:preview
npm run build:android:preview

# OTA updates for preview testers
npm run update:preview -- --message "QA update"
```

### Web (Firebase Hosting)
```bash
npm run build-web
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Single app policy

- CulturePass runs from one app codebase in this repository (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, etc.) for iOS, Android, and Web.
- Do not create or use standalone web app folders for runtime/deployment.
- Web deployment is exported from Expo to `dist/` and served by Firebase Hosting.

## Core Product Surface

- **Event Discovery** — Browse, search, and filter cultural events by city, category, and date
- **Community Hub** — Join and manage diaspora communities
- **Ticketing** — Purchase tickets, QR code scanning, Apple/Google Wallet integration
- **Business Directory** — Find cultural restaurants, venues, and local businesses
- **Membership Tiers** — Free, Plus, Elite, Pro, Premium, VIP with cashback perks
- **Loyalty Perks** — Earn and redeem rewards across the platform
- **First Nations Spotlight** — Celebrating Indigenous Australian culture
- **Australia-first** — Local discovery, location, and publishing flows tuned for Australian release

## Engineering Rules

- Use `lib/api.ts` as the only app-level HTTP entry point.
- Use `useColors()` and tokens from `constants/theme.ts`; never hardcode hex values in components.
- Use `expo-image` for runtime image rendering.
- Preserve canonical routes and legacy remaps together across Expo Router, native intent handling, and Firebase Hosting.

## Design System

The app uses a unified token system for a consistent white-first marketplace UI:

| Module | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Colors | `constants/colors.ts` | Light/dark themes, glassmorphism, gradient presets |
| Typography | `constants/typography.ts` | Poppins font family, iOS-style type scale |
| Spacing | `constants/spacing.ts` | 4-point grid, border radii, layout constants |
| Animations | `constants/animations.ts` | Duration, spring configs, motion preferences |

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push and PR:
- **TypeScript type check** — catches type errors
- **ESLint** — enforces code style
- **Unit tests** — validates services and middleware
- **Web export** — verifies the web bundle compiles

See `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml` for the full pipeline.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, React Native 0.81, Expo 54, Expo Router 6
- **State**: TanStack Query 5, React Context
- **UI**: Reanimated 4, Expo Linear Gradient, Expo Blur / Glass Effect
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (Express), Node.js 22, TypeScript 5.9
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (web), Firebase Functions (API), EAS (native builds)

The target upgrade path documented by engineering is Expo SDK 55 and React Native 0.83.x. Keep docs and code aligned when that migration lands.

## Notes for Replit to production migration

Set environment variables in your deployment platform:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` (recommended)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (legacy fallback)

This lets the same codebase run cleanly across local dev, Replit, Firebase, and production infra.
